# Obra Border Radius Fixer

This plugin will detect the available border radius variables in your file.

Make sure you have variables of the type “number” that are ideally scoped to the “Corner Radius” property.

Now, use this plugin to scan a selection of layer to see if they comply with the “legal” border radius values.

Don't select too many layers at once or the plugin will crash. But depending on your system specs, it can handle +-10k layers at once (tested on my Macbook Pro M3).

Now either apply fixes individually, or use the “autofix” button to apply the border radius variables.
